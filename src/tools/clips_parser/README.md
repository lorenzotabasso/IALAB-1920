# CLIPS Parser

In this folder there are two Python scripts.

## Heatmap Parser

The script we used to print the heatmap computed by the CLIPS interpreter (specifically by the Heat module), to verify if it was correct and to put it in the final summary.

### Usage

In order to improve readability, we'll use the following shortening:

- ```final path```: path to the .txt file containing CLIPS output,
- ```heatmap path```: path to the .txt file containing the CLIPS output for the heatmap (generated by Heat module),
- ```output path```: path of the folder in which put the output image

```python
python3 heatmap_parser.py -f <final path>  -t <heatmap path> -o <output path>
```

## Experiments

The script we used to run our experiment with CLIPS. It invokes CLIPS from command line and it runs some experiments. It also save the heatmap for every map associated with the experiment.

**NOTE**: for now, it only works on Windows enviroment (we actually don't know why, the Python code is correct and should run in every enviroment!). Feel free to edit it and make it works on Unix if you have time (we didn't had).

### Usage

In order to improve readability, we'll use the following shortening:

- ```maps path```: path to the maps folder,
- ```agent path```: path to the agent folder,
- ```experiments path```: path to the agent folder,
- ```experiment name```: name of the set of experiments (default is "all"),
- ```params set name```: we no longer remember... :(

```python
python3 experiments.py -m <maps path>  -a <agent path> -e <experiments path> -en <experiments name> -p <params set name>
```

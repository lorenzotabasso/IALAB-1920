# YAPT

Yet Another Pathfinding Tool (YAPT) is a small javascript based utility to paint mazes and transpile them in Prolog predicates. 

The utility is pretty basic and doesn't enforce any semantic control on the generated predicates (eg. multiple start and end cells).



## TODO

* Someone should provide a decent UI!
* Extend brush types
